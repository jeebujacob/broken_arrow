** file name - klalgofixed.py

** input file required - branches.txt

** branches.txt - consists of all edges between vertices in graph

** command to run file - python klalgorihtm.py

** vertices no is fixed which is 8 for this perticular program

** you can provide any graph having no of vertices 8

** description - This code start with some initial partitioning and divides graph 
                  into two graphs by iterating over graph using Kernighan-Lin algo.
                 Two subgraphs will have minimum cutsets between them.
