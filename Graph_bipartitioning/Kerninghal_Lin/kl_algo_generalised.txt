** file name - kl_algo_generalised.py

** input file required - branches.txt

** branches.txt - consists of all edges between vertices in graph

** command to run file - python klalgorihtm.py

** vertices no can be any thing but less than or equal to 10

** you can provide any graph having no of vertices less than or equal to 10

** description - This code start with some initial partitioning and divides graph 
                  into two graphs by iterating over graph using Kernighan-Lin algo.
                 Two subgraphs will have minimum cutsets between them.
